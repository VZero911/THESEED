/**
 * @dev Library for managing
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)[sets] of primitive
 * types.
 *
 * Sets have the following properties:
 *
 * - Elements are added, removed, and checked for existence in constant time
 * (O(1)).
 * - Elements are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering.
 * - Set can be cleared (all elements removed) in O(n).
 *
 * ```solidity
 * contract Example {
 *     // Add the library methods
 *     using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;
 *
 *     // Declare a set state variable
 *     EnumerableSet.AddressSet private mySet;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The following types are supported:
 *
 * - `bytes32` (`Bytes32Set`) since v3.3.0
 * - `address` (`AddressSet`) since v3.3.0
 * - `uint256` (`UintSet`) since v3.3.0
 * - `string` (`StringSet`) since v5.4.0
 * - `bytes` (`BytesSet`) since v5.4.0
 * - `bytes4` (`Bytes4Set`) since v5.6.0
 *
 * [WARNING]
 * ====
 * Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure
 * unusable.
 * See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info.
 *
 * In order to clean an EnumerableSet, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an
 * array of EnumerableSet.
